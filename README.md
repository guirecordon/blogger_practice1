I was reading Justin Weiss' book 'Practicing Rails' the other day, and I think it was there that I read the reference made to the Chinese proverb related to the Go game. It said something like: 'Fail your first 50 games fast'. Justin made the connection to learning Rails. The idea is to build your first 50 apps in Rails as fast as possible to get a successful overall experience.

That is my fourth app in Rails. It's been a lot more fun to do things that way. I've used that type of methodology to learn other things before. I know it works, so I'm pursuing that path with Rails.
